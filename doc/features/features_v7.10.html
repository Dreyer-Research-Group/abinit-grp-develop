<h3><b><a name="0">0.</a> Related documentation</b></h3>

Besides the documentation available on the Web,
there is a wealth of information inside the package itself, see the
directory "doc".
The reader might consult the latest version of the "doc/users/context.txt" file
for the description of the ABINIT project and its history.
The different versions of the "doc/release_notes/*html" files will allow to
see the actual development of the project since version 1.5,
released in August 1998. They give also an idea of on-going developments.
Discussions on the <a href="http://forum.abinit.org">forum</a> might also 
allow to get documentation.

<h3><b><a name="1">1.</a> Available physical properties</b></h3>

<h4><b><a name="1.A">1.A.</a> Computation of the total energy of an assembly of nuclei and electrons
placed in a repeated cell.</b></h4>

<ul>
<li>
1.A.1. The computation can be done using (1) plane waves and norm-conserving
pseudopotentials, or, (2) so-called
"Projector-Augmented Waves" (PAW method), with appropriate pseudoatomic data,
or (3) wavelets, see 1.A.14.
</li>
<br>
<li>
1.A.2. The total energy computation is done according to the Density Functional
Theory (also +U and DMFT, see 1.A.15 and 1.A.20). 
Many exchange-correlation functionals are available,
through two different implementations : one is the native ABINIT implementation,
the other is the ETSF library of XC functionals (LibXC is a plug-in to ABINIT).
In the native ABINIT set,
most of the important local approximations (LDA) are
available, including the Perdew-Zunger one. Two different local spin density
(LSD) are available, including the Perdew Wang 92, and one due to M. Teter.
The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof,  the revPBE, the RPBE
and the HCTH GGAs (spin unpolarized as well as polarized)
are also available.

In the LibXC 2.0 library, as interfaced with ABINIT,
there are 24 functional forms of the 3D LDA type, and over 80 functional forms of the GGA type.
They can be used with norm-conserving pseudopotentials as well as PAW atomic data.
Also, some metaGGA can be used with ABINIT (norm-conserving case only).
For response-function type calculations, the native ABINIT LDA and GGA kernels 
can be used as well as the LibXC ones.

The exchange can also be computed on the basis of the Fock expression (exact exchange), and the correlation
can be computed on the basis of the RPA approximation (see the GW section).
Hybrid functionals calculations (HSE06, PBE0, B3LYP) can be performed.
The implementation of the exact exchange, correlation and hybrid does not deliver the forces and stresses at present.

Several Van Der Waals functionals are available : Grimme, Silvestrelli.
</li>
<br>
<li>
1.A.3. Self-consistent calculations will generate the DFT ground-state,
with associated energy and density. Afterwards, a non-self-consistent
calculation might generate eigenenergies at a large number
of k-points, for band structures. The electronic Density-Of-States
can be computed either within the tetrahedron method, or using a smearing
technique.
</li>
<br>
<li>
1.A.4. The program admits many different types of pseudopotentials.
There are two complete sets of pseudopotentials available for
the whole periodic table, one of the Troullier-Martins type,
one of the Goedecker type (this one include the spin-orbit coupling).
Three large sets of PAW atomic data can be read by ABINIT.
One is from GPAW (0.9), another one has been developed by ABINIT developers,
see http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7274.
 a third one by  K.F. Garrity, J.W. Bennet, K.M. Rabe, D. Vanderbilt, arXiv:1305.5973v1
Both are in the PAW XML format. They have been tested against all-electron
calculations, see http://molmod.ugent.be/DeltaCodesDFT 
Most elements in the periodic table are present, except the rare earth elements and actinides.

Five codes are available to generate
new pseudopotentials when needed. Two of them are able to generate
pseudopotentials with a core hole, in order to compute core-level shifts.
(see the ABINIT web site).

Two of them are able to generate GGA pseudopotentials.
The ultra-soft pseudopotentials are approximations of the
Projector Augmented Wave approach, and are treated within this framework.
Norm-conserving pseudopotentials can be mixed, to generate "alchemical" pseudoatoms.
See also section 1.G.8, for the special case of the AtomPAW generator.
</li>
<br>
<li>
1.A.5. Metallic as well as insulating systems can be treated. Schemes for
determination of the occupation number include the Fermi broadening,
the Gaussian broadening, the Gaussian-Hermite broadening, as well as
the modifications proposed by Marzari. Finite temperatures
can also be treated using a smearing scheme (Verstraete scheme).
</li>
<br>
<li>
1.A.6. The cell may be orthogonal or non-orthogonal.
Any kind of symmetries and corresponding sets of k-point can be input,
and taken into account in the computation.
</li>
<br>
<li>
1.A.7. The electronic system may be computed in the
spin-unpolarized or spin-polarized
case, with the possibility to impose occupation numbers of majority and
minority spins, and the spins of the starting configuration.
A specific option for efficient treatment of
anti-ferromagnetism (Shubnikov groups) is available.
The treatment of non-collinear magnetism is available.
The total magnetic moment of the unit cell can be constrained.
The local magnetization can also be constrained.
</li>
<br>
<li>
1.A.8. The total energy, forces, stresses, and electronic structure
can be provided with the spin-orbit coupling included.
</li>
<br>
<li>
1.A.9. A finite electric field can be imposed on insulators, using the proper
Hamiltonian for periodic systems based on Berry's phase. The generalisation
to fixed D-field or fixed reduced fields are also available,
as described in M. Stengel, N.A. Spaldin and D. Vanderbilt, Nat. Phys. 5,304 (2009).
</li>
<br>
<li>
1.A.10. The decomposition of energy in its different component (local potential,
XC, hartree ...) is provided.
</li>
<br>
<li>
1.A.11. Inner electronic eigenvalues can be computed thanks to the
minimisation of the residual with respect to a target energy value.
</li>
<br>
<li>
1.A.12. The charge density of states close to the Fermi energy can be output,
and provide a simple approach to STM image calculations (not for PAW).
The angular momentum decomposed DOS can be evaluated in a sphere around any point,
and provide STS analysis.
</li>
<br>
<li>
1.A.13. The lifetime of positrons and their annihilation rate can be computed,
using the self-consistent two-component DFT, including force and stress computation,
LDA and GGA, norm-conserving as well as PAW.
</li>
<br>
<li>
1.A.14. The use of wavelets (instead of plane waves) is also being implemented.
At present, it works for the SCF cycles : one can get density, total energy
and forces, in some basic cases (HGH or GTH pseudopotentials only, or PAW - in v7.2).
Available also : the finite size corrections to the
total energy, restart on wavefunctions following the ETSF norm and geometry
relaxation using BFGS. Molecular dynamic is also available for
test purposes.
</li>
<br>
<li>
1.A.15. The DFT+U approximation is also available (LDA+U, GGA+U), on the basis
of PAW calculations.
Available for non-spin-polarized, spin-polarized, and spinor cases (with spin-orbit also).
The U and J values can be determined using the method by Coccocioni and De Gironcoli,
as well as from a cRPA (constrained RPA) calculation.

and corresponds exactly to the limit of finite differences of energy
for infinitesimally small atomic displacements when the ground-state
calculation is at convergence. This feature is available for all the

Available also for the GGAs (except the HCTH one).

</li>

("rigid-ion" as well as "relaxed"), the piezoelectricity tensor,
as well as the so-called "internal strains", change of forces to atoms
due to a strain, or change of the stress due to an atomic displacement.

</li>
<br>
<li>
1.B.11. For norm-conserving pseudopotentials, selected non-linear
response coefficients can be computed thanks to the
2n+1 theorem of perturbation theory. At present :
- the electro-optic coefficients 
   (no treatment of spin-polarized cases or spin-orbit coupling yet)
- the Raman cross sections
   (no treatment of spin-orbit coupling yet)
This is available for the non-spin-polarized case and the
spin-polarized case, but only in some flavors of LDA at present.

</li>
<br>
<li>
1.B.12. For norm-conserving pseudopotentials,
electron-phonon matrix elements are available directly from the
output of a linear-response phonon calculation. They can be analyzed
to give e.g. the phonon linewidth or superconducting temperature.
(no treatment of spin-polarized cases or spin-orbit coupling yet),

of the Hamiltonian has been highly optimized, and take into account
the fact that the wavefunction do not fill the reciprocal space FFT box.
Library FFTs are also available, but they are found to be slower than the
present FFT routine, developed starting from a routine
provided by S. Goedecker.
A real-to-complex FFT is used for treating potential and densities
of the ground state, since they are real.
For selected k-points, invariant under time-reversal symmetry,
( (0 0 0), (1/2 0 0), (0 1/2 0), (0 0 1/2), (1/2 1/2 0) ... (1/2 1/2 1/2) ),
the number of planewave explicitly treated is divided by two. A
real-to-complex FFT is used then.

</li>
<br>
<li>
2.A.3. The non-local potential is applied in reciprocal space. It has been
optimized carefully, although there is still some speed-up to be
coded when the k-point is invariant under time-reversal.
The orthogonalisation procedure can be done twice per loop or only once.

</li>
<br>
<li>
2.A.4. At the level of the generation of electronic eigenfunctions, an efficient
band-by-band preconditioned conjugate-gradient algorithm is used,
in its non-self-consistent version. An alternative algorithm "lobpcg"
is also available.

</li>
<br>
<li>
2.A.5. At the level of the self-consistency loop, an efficient
potential-based preconditioned conjugate-gradient algorithm is used.
Simple mixing is also available, as well as the Anderson algorithm.
Preconditioning of this algorithm is achieved through a model
dielectric function, or through an approximate dielectric matrix.
</li>
<br>
</ul>

<h4><b><a name="2.B">2.B.</a> Speed in the parallel version.</b></h4>

<ul>
<li>
2.B.1. For ground-state calculations, MPI-based parallelism.
The code has been parallelized
on the k-points, on the spins, on the spinor components, on the bands,
and on the FFT grid and plane wave coefficients.
For the k-point and spin parallelisations (using MPI), the communication
load is generally very small. This allows it to be used on a cluster of workstations.
However, the number of nodes that can be used in parallel might
be small, and depends strongly on the physics of the problem.
A combined FFT / band parallelisation is available, and has shown
very large speed up (>1000) on powerful computers with a large number of processors
and high-speed interconnect. The combination of FFT / band / k point and spin
parallelism is also available, and quite efficient for such computers.
Available for norm-conserving as well as PAW cases.
Automatic determination of the best combination of parallelism levels is available.
Use of MPIIO is mandatory for the largest speed ups to be observed.
</li>
<li>
2.B.2. For ground-state calculations, with a set of images (e.g. nudged elastic band method,
the string method, the path-integral molecular dynamics, the genetic algorithm), MPI-based parallelism.
The work load for the different images has been distributed, and this marallelism can be 
combined with the parallelism described in point 2.B.1, leading to speed-up beyond 5000.
</li>
<li>
2.B.3. For ground-state calculations, GPU can be used. This is based on CUDA+MAGMA.
</li>
<br>
<li>
2.B.4. For ground-state calculations, the wavelet part of ABINIT (BigDFT) is also very well parallelized :
MPI band parallelism, combined with GPUs.
</li>
<li>
2.B.5. For response calculations, MPI-based parallelism.
The code has been parallelized
on k-points, spins, bands, as well as on perturbations.
For the k-points, spins and bands parallelisation,
the communication load is rather
small also, and, unlike for the GS calculations, the number
of nodes that can be used in parallel will be large,
nearly independently of the physics of the problem.
Parallelism on perturbations is very similar to the parallelism on images in the ground state case (so, very efficient),
although the load balancing problem for perturbations with different number of k points is not adressed at present.
Use of MPIIO is mandatory for the largest speed ups to be observed.
</li>
<br>
<li>
2.B.6. GW calculations are MPI-parallelized over k-points.
They are also parallelized over transitions (valence to conduction band pairs), but the two parallelisation
cannot be used currently at present.
The transition parallelism has been show to allow speed ups as large as 300.
</li>
<br>
<li>
2.B.7. Ground state, response function, and GW parallel calculations 
can be done also by using OpenMP parallelism, even combined with MPI parallelism. 
</li>

</ul>

<h4><b><a name="2.C">2.C.</a> Memory.</b></h4>

<ul>
<li>
2.C.1. The requirements of the different conjugate gradient algorithms
on memory are relatively low, especially when the number of atoms
is large. Optionally, it is even possible to use disk space
to save memory, at the expense of computing time.
In particular, when the number of k points is large, they can
be stored in memory one at a time. Phase factors in the application of
the non-local operator can also be recomputed at each application,
in order to save memory. For k-points that are invariant under
time-reversal symmetry, the storage required for wavefunctions
is half the storage for other k-point.

 </ul>
</li>
<br>
</ul>


<h4><b><a name="3.B">3.B.</a> Portability.</b></h4>

<ul>
<li>
3.B.1. The ABINIT package v6 is routinely installed (sequential and parallel) on different platforms :

<ul>
 <li> PC/Linux based on Intel Xeon processors or AMD processors
 with GFort compiler, g95 compiler, Intel compiler, pathscale compiler.</li>
 <li> PC under Windows </li>
 <li> ItaniumII </li>
 <li> IBM RS6000 based on Power processors </li>
 <li> Mac OS X </li>
</ul>

</li>
<br>
<li>
3.B.2. Installation is made thanks to the autotools (autoconf and automake)
as well as different scripts. All machine-dependent parameters
are grouped in one single short file for each machine.
The parallel and sequential
version of the code, as well as the different versions for the different
machines, are prepared on-the-fly,
so that there is only one unique source code.

</li>
<br>
<li>
3.B.3. Binaries for different machines can be managed in the
same main directory, as they might be placed automatically in different
sub-directories.
</li>
<br>
</ul>

<h4><b><a name="3.C">3.C.</a> Running jobs, input and output files.</b></h4>

<ul>
<li>
3.C.1. The input variables are gathered in one unique file,
read by a text processing facility build in the code.
Many defaults values are provided, so that
the input file can be kept rather short.

</li>
<br>
<li>
3.C.2. Many different stopping criteria allow the user to target the accuracy
he or she wants to obtain.

</li>
<br>
<li>
3.C.3. The outputs are provided to one main file and one auxiliary file,
as well as different specialized files (for density, potential,
wavefunctions, ...) .
The main file is shorter than the auxiliary file, and well formatted,
while all important results are gathered
there. It can be used for archival purposes. The auxiliary (log) file
will contain all exception messages.

</li>
<br>
<li>
3.C.4. Exception handling is provided through four different types
of messages : COMMENT, WARNING, BUG and ERROR. In each case, the
accurate meaning of the exception is described, as well as the
eventual action to be taken by the user.

</li>
<br>
<li>
3.C.5. Statistics of foreseen memory and disk usage is printed at
the beginning of the run. Statistics of CPU time usage
is printed at the end of the run.

</li>
<br>
<li>
3.C.6. There is a facility to stop the run in a clean way at any time.
The user may specify a cpu time limit, after which the job must end
smoothly.

</li>
<br>
<li>
3.C.7. A status file, updated very frequently, gives an on-the-fly
report of progress of the current run.

</li>
<br>
<li>
3.C.8. The code can handle multiple datasets contained in the input
file, where generic input variables valid for all datasets
can be defined. These calculations for different dataset
can be chained, so that in one run, many complex tasks can be accomplished.
This allows easy convergence studies.

</li>
<br>
<li>
3.C.9. The code can start the current run from a wavefunction input file
generated in a previous run. This allows to cut down the number
of iteration to self-consistency, or to perform other tasks.
This can be done even if the previous job
had different computational parameters, like different k points,
different energy cut-off, spin-unpolarized or spin-polarized wavefunctions,
scalr or spinor wavefunctions ... Of course, the restart from
wildly different parameters will not save a lot of CPU time.

</li>
<br>
<li>
3.C.10. ABINIT can produce CML (Chemical Markup Language) output files.
It can also read the CML files it produced.
</li>
<br>

<li>
3.C.11. A GUI is available, see the directory gui, also containing instructions to run it.
</li>
<br>
</ul>

<br>
<li>
3.E.2. Anti-ferromagnetic symmetry operations, and associated
magnetic space groups (Shubnikov groups) can be treated with the
same facility as usual space groups, including a database of the
1191 Shubnikov groups.

</li>
