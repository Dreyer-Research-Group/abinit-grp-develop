This page explains how portability and non-regression is managed in the ABINIT project.

## Introduction

ABINIT is tested at each merge in the trunk, on a dedicated test farm, see
[[https://wiki.abinit.org/doku.php?id=bb:slaves]]
and
[[https://wiki.abinit.org/doku.php?id=bb:builder]]. The
numerous tests contained in ~abinit/tests are executed, and compared with
reference files.
