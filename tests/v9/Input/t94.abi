#%%   See test v9#41 for DFPT, with the same PAW atomic data, and same usexcnhat=0 (default).
#%%   The total energy and stress change very little within the set of non-collinear calculations
#%%   However they differ a little (etotal) or a lot (stress) between the collinear calculation and the non-collinear calculation.
#%%   The similarity was much better for norm-conserving pseudos (see test v9#13) or PAW with usexcnhat=1 .
#%%   This seems suscpicious and should be clarified.
