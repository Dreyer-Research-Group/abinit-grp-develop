# Second lesson on GW  

## Treatment of metals.  

This lesson aims at showing how to obtain self-energy corrections to the DFT
Kohn-Sham eigenvalues within the GW approximation, in the metallic case,
without the use of a plasmon-pole model. 
The band width and Fermi energy of Aluminum will be computed.  

The user may read the paper

  * F. Bruneval, N. Vast, and L. Reining, Phys. Rev. B **74** , 045102 (2006), 
for some information and results about the GW treatment of Aluminum. He will
also find there an analysis of the effect of self-consistency on
quasiparticles in solids (not present in this tutorial, however available in
Abinit). The description of the contour deformation technique that bypasses
the use of a plasmon-pole model to calculate the frequency convolution of G
and W can be found in

  * S. Lebegue, S. Arnaud, M. Alouani, P. Bloechl, Phys. Rev. B 67, 155208 (2003), 

with the relevant formulas. We will refer to these papers as the [[cite:Bruneval2006]] 
and the [[cite:Lebegue2003]] papers.

A brief description of the equations implemented in the code can be found in the [[theory:mbt|GW notes]]
Also, it is suggested to acknowledge the efforts of developers of the GW part of ABINIT, 
by citing the [[cite:Gonze2005|2005 ABINIT publication]].

The user should be familiarized with the four basic lessons of ABINIT, see the
[[lesson:index]] as well as the [[lesson:gw1|first GW lesson]].

This lesson should take about one hour to be completed (also including the
reading of [[cite:Bruneval2006]] and [[cite:Lebegue2003]].

## 1 The preliminary Kohn-Sham band structure calculation

*Before beginning, you might consider to work in a different subdirectory as
for the other lessons. Why not "Work_gw2"?*

In [[lesson:base4|lesson 4]], we have computed different properties of
Aluminum within the LDA. Unlike for silicon, in this approximation, there is
no outstanding problem in the computed band structure. Nevertheless, as you
will see, the agreement of the band structure with experiment can be improved
significantly if one relies on the GW approximation.

In the directory ~abinit/tests/tutorial/Input/Work_gw2, copy the files
~abinit/tests/tutorial/Input/tgw2_x.files and tgw2_1.in, and modify the
tgw2_x.files file as usual (see [[lesson:base1]]).  
Then (supposing abinit is the proper alias), issue:
    
    abinit < tgw2_x.files >& tgw2_1.log &

{% dialog tests/tutorial/Input/tgw2_x.files tests/tutorial/Input/tgw2_1.in %}
    
This run generates the WFK file for the subsequent GW computation and also
provides the band width of Aluminum. Note that the simple Fermi-Dirac smearing
functional is used ([[occopt]]=3), with a large smearing ([[tsmear]]=0.05 Ha).
The k point grid is quite rough, an unshifted 4x4x4 Monkhorst-Pack grid (64 k
points in the full Brillouin Zone, folding to 8 k points in the Irreducible
wedge, [[ngkpt]]=4 4 4). Converged results would need a 4x4x4 grid with 4
shifts (256 k points in the full Brillouin zone). This grid contains the Gamma
point, at which the valence band structure reaches its minimum.

The output file presents the Fermi energy
    
     Fermi (or HOMO) energy (eV) =   7.14774   Average Vxc (eV)=  -9.35982

as well as the lowest energy, at the Gamma point
    
     Eigenvalues (   eV  ) for nkpt=   8  k points:
     kpt#   1, nband=  6, wtk=  0.01563, kpt=  0.0000  0.0000  0.0000 (reduced coord)
      -3.76175  19.92114  19.92114  19.92114  21.00078  21.00078

So, the occupied band width is 10.90 eV. More converged calculations would give 11.06 eV (see [[cite:Bruneval2006]]).  
This is to be compared to the experimental value of 10.6 eV (see references in [[cite:Bruneval2006]]).

## 2 Calculation of the screening file
  
In order not to lose time, let us start the calculation of the screening file
before the examination of the corresponding input file. So, copy the file
tgw2_2.in, and modify the tgw2_x.files file as usual (replace occurrences of
twg2_x by tgw2_2). Also, copy the WFK file (tgw2_1o_WFK) to tgw2_2i_WFK. Then
run the calculation (it should take about 30 seconds on a 3 GHz PC).

{% dialog tests/tutorial/Input/tgw2_2.in %}

We now have to consider starting a GW calculation. However, unlike in the case
of Silicon in the previous GW tutorial, where we were focussing on quantities
close to the Fermi energy (spanning a range of a few eV), here we need to
consider a much wider range of energy: the bottom of the valence band lies
around -11 eV below the Fermi level. Unfortunately, this energy is of the same
order of magnitude as the plasmon excitations. With a rough evaluation, the
classical plasma frequency for a homogeneous electron gas with a density equal
to the average valence density of Aluminum is 15.77 eV. Hence, using 
plasmon-pole models may be not really appropriate.

In what follows, one will compute the GW band structure without a plasmon-pole
model, by performing explicitly the numerical frequency convolution. In
practice, it is convenient to extend all the functions of frequency to the
full complex plane. And then, making use of the residue theorem, the
integration path can be deformed: one transforms an integral along the real
axis into an integral along the imaginary axis plus residues enclosed in the
new contour of integration. The method is extensively described in [[cite:Lebegue2003]].

Examine the input file tgw2_2.in. The ten first lines contain the important
information. There, you find some input variables that you are already
familiarized with, like [[optdriver]], [[ecuteps]], [[ecutwfn]], but also new
input variables: [[gwcalctyp]], [[nfreqim]], [[nfreqre]], and [[freqremax]].
The purpose of this run is simply to generate the screening matrices. Unlike
for the plasmon-pole models, one needs to compute these at many different
frequencies. This is the purpose of the new input variables. The main variable
[[gwcalctyp]] is set to 2 in order to specify a _non_ plasmon-pole model
calculation. Note that the number of frequencies along the imaginary axis
governed by [[nfreqim]] can be chosen quite small, since all functions are
smooth in this direction. In contrast, the number of frequencies needed along
the real axis set with the variable [[nfreqre]] is usually larger.

## 3 Finding the Fermi energy and the bottom of the valence band
  
In order not to lose time, let us start the calculation of the band width
before the study of the input file. So, copy the file tgw2_3.in, and modify
the tgw3_x.files file as usual (replace occurrences of twg2_x by tgw2_3).
Also, copy the WFK file (tgw2_1o_WFK) to tgw2_3i_WFK, and the screening file
(tgw2_2o_SCR) to tgw2_3i_SCR. Then run the calculation (it should take about 2 minutes on a 3 GHz PC).

The computation of the GW quasi-particle energy at the Gamma point of Aluminum
does not differ from the one of quasi-particle in Silicon. However, the
determination of the Fermi energy raises a completely new problem: one should
sample the Brillouin Zone, to get new energies (quasi-particle energies) and
then determine the Fermi energy. This is actually the first step towards a self-consistency!

Examine the input file tgw2_3.in:

{% dialog tests/tutorial/Input/tgw2_3.in %}

The first thirty lines contain the important information. 
There, you find some input variables with values that you are
already familiarized with, like [[optdriver]], [[ecutsigx]], [[ecutwfn]].
Then, comes the input variable [[gwcalctyp]]=12. The value _x2_ corresponds to
a contour integration. The value _1x_ corresponds to a self-consistent
calculation with update of the energies only. Then, one finds the list of k
points and bands for which a quasi-particle correction will be computed:
[[nkptgw]], [[kptgw]], and [[bdgw]]. The number and list of k points is simply
the same as [[nkpt]] and [[kpt]]. One might have specified less k points,
though (only those needing an update). The list of band ranges [[bdgw]] has
been generated on the basis of the LDA eigenenergies. We considered only the
bands in the vicinity of the Fermi level: bands much below or much above are
likely to remain much or much above the Fermi region. In the present run, we
are just interested in the states that may cross the Fermi level, when going
from LDA to GW. For commodity, one could have selected an homogeneous range
for the whole Brillouin zone, e.g. from 1 to 5, but this would have been more time-consuming.

In the output file, one finds the quasi-particle energy at Gamma, for the lowest band:
    
    k =    0.000   0.000   0.000
     Band     E_lda   <Vxclda>   E(N-1)  <Hhartree>   SigX  SigC[E(N-1)]    Z     dSigC/dE  Sig[E(N)]  DeltaE  E(N)_pert E(N)_diago
        1    -3.762    -9.451    -3.762     5.689   -15.049     5.676     0.777    -0.287    -9.390     0.060    -3.701    -3.684
    
(the last column is the relevant quantity). The updated Fermi energy is also mentioned:
    
     New Fermi energy:     2.469501E-01 Ha ,    6.719854E+00 eV

The last information is not printed in case of [[gwcalctyp]] lower than 10.

Combining the quasi-particle energy at Gamma and the Fermi energy, gives the
band width, 10.404 eV. Using converged parameters, the band width will be
10.54 eV (see Bruneval[2006]). This is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 10.6 eV.

## 4 Computing a GW spectral function, and the plasmon satellite of Aluminum
  
The access to the non-plasmon-pole-model self-energy (real and imaginary part)
has additional benefit, e.g. an accurate spectral function can be computed,
see [[cite:Lebegue2003]]. You may be interested to see the plasmon satellite of
Aluminum, which can be accounted for within the GW approximation. 

Remember that the spectral function is almost (except some matrix elements) the spectrum which
is measured in photoemission spectroscopy (PES). In PES, a photon impinges the
sample and extracts an electron from the material. The difference of energy
between the incoming photon and the obtained electron gives the binding energy
of the electron in the solid, or in other words the quasiparticle energy or
the band structure. In simple metals, an additional process can take place
easily: the impinging photon can **extract an electron together with a global
charge oscillation in the sample**. The extracted electron will have a kinetic
energy lower than in the direct process, because a part of the energy has gone
to the plasmon. The electron will appear to have a larger binding energy...
You will see that the spectral function of Aluminum consists of a main peak
which corresponds to the quasiparticle excitation and some additional peaks
which correspond to quasiparticle and plasmon excitations together.

In order not to lose time, this calculation can be started before the
examination of the input file. So, copy the file tgw2_4.in, and modify the
tgw4_x.files file as usual (replace occurrences of twg2_x by tgw2_4). Also,
copy the WFK file (tgw2_1o_WFK) to tgw2_4i_WFK, and the screening file
(tgw2_2o_SCR) to tgw2_4i_SCR. 
Then run the calculation (it should take about 2 minutes on a 3 GHz PC).

{% dialog tests/tutorial/Input/tgw2_4.in %}

Compared to the previous file (tgw2_3.in), the input file contains two
additional keywords: [[nfreqsp]], and [[freqspmax]]. Also, the computation of
the GW self-energy is done only at the Gamma point.

The spectral function is written in the file tgw2_4o_SIG. It is a simple text
file. It contains, as a function of the frequency (eV), the real part of the
self-energy, the imaginary part of the self-energy, and the spectral function.
You can visualize it using your preferred software. For instance, issue
    
    $ gnuplot
    gnuplot>  p'tgw2_4o_SIG' u 1:4 w l

You should be able to distinguish the main quasiparticle peak located at the
GW energy (-3.7 eV) and some additional features in the vicinity of the GW
eigenvalue minus a plasmon energy (-3.7 eV - 15.8 eV = -19.5 eV).

Another file, tgw2_4o_GW, is worth to mention: it contains information to be
used for the subsequent calculation of excitonic effects by the EXC code
(usually available at http://theory.polytechnique.fr/codes/exc; if not, see
the [ETSF software page](http://www.etsf.eu/resources/software/codes) and further links).
