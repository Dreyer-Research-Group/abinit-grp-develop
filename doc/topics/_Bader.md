This page gives hints on how to perform a Bader analysis with the ABINIT package.

## Introduction

The postprocessor of ABINIT, called AIM (Atom-In-Molecule), performs the Bader
analysis on the basis of the charge density, norm-conserving pseudopotential
cases only, complemented by the core charge densities provided in
[[https://www.abinit.org/downloads/core_electron]]. There is a specific
[[help:aim]] for this ABINIT postprocessor.
