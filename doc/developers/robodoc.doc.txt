## How to fix Robodoc warnings

The following section is aimed at helping developers to solve problems related to robodoc error messages.
It comes from the file *doc/developers/robodoc.doc.txt*

A robodoc section must always start with a "begin marker" and end with a "end marker".
In ABINIT, the begin marker is usually:

    !!****f*

or
    
    !!****m*

while the end marker is always
    
    !!***

A common problem when generating .html for ABINIT thanks to Robodoc, is the lack of an end marker
for each begin marker. The solution is simple: find the end of the robodoc section (often, either
the end of file, or just before the next begin marker), and insert

    !!***
