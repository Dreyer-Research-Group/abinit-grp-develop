TODO list for developers
========================

Refactoring the source code
---------------------------

### 02_clib ###

The 02_clib library has been written when Abinit relied on the Fortran 90/95
standards. Now that we have switched to Fortran 2003, its contents should be
rewritten using the ISO_C_BINDING module, which will remove the need for most
of the current C files in this directory.
