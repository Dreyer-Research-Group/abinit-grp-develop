This page gives hints on how to perform a molecular dynamics calculation with the Multibinit package.

## Introduction

Multibinit uses the molecular dynamics algorithm implemented in the Abinit software (see [[topic:MolecularDynamics|Molecular dynamics in Abinit]]). For now, only NPT ([[ionmov]]=13) and NVT ([[ionmov]]==12) simulations are available.
