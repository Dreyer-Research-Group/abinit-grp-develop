# Ground-state FAQs

This page collects FAQs related to the GS part of Abinit.

Many mistakes done by beginners are related to **incorrect starting geometry**.
Here is a check list:

- Check that the units are correct for your cell parameters and atomic positions. 
  ABINIT uses atomic unit by default, but can use several other units if specified by the user, see ABINIT input parameters.
- Check that the [[typat]] atom types are correct with respect to [[xred]] or [[xcart]]
- Check that the number of atoms [[natom]] is coherent with your list of coordinates, xred or xcart. 
  ABINIT reads only the coordinates of natom nuclei and ignore others.
- Try to visualize your primitive cell. There are numerous possibilities, using Abipy, VESTA, XCrysDen (to be documented).

- ABINIT can read VASP POSCAR or Netcdf external files containing unit cell parameters and atomic positions. 
  See the input variable structure. This might help in setting the geometry correctly.

- Relax first the atomic positions at fixed primitive vectors before optimizing the cell. 
  Explicitly, use a first datadet with [[optcell]] = 0, then a second dataset with non-zero optcell, 
  in which you tell ABINIT to read optimized atomic positions using [[getxred]] or [[getxcart]]. 
  In this second dataset, do not forget to use [[dilatmx]] bigger than 1 if you expect the volume 
  of the cell to increase during the optimization. 
  Possibly after the atomic position relaxation, make a run with [[chkdilatmx]] = 0, then a third run with [[dilatmx]] = 1. 
  See the additional suggestions in the documentation of [[optcell]].

## Is it a good idea to set the number of bands to the highest occupied state to accelerate a GS calculation?

The answer is No and the explanation requires some technical discussion about the KS solver. 
In principle, the worload and the memory footprint is proportional to [[nband]] so, at first sight, it may 
be

In the case of non-magnetic semiconductors ([[nsppol]] == 1), one can in principle set [[nband]] 
to the highest occupied band index i.e. the total number of valence electrons divided by 2 (4 for Silicon).
On the other hand, the GS solver may require less iteration including empty states in the GS run 
usually helps to reach convergence


!!! important 

    In the case of metals, one needs partially occupied states to account for the tail of the occupation 
    function [[occoopt]] and the broadening parameter [[tsmear]] so this is a **very bad idea** 


## The SCF cycle does not converge

The default SCF algorithm for SCF (see [[iscf]]) is an excellent compromise between speed and robustness. 
It is referred to as Pulay II in Fig. 10 of 
N. D. Woods and M. C. Payne and P. J. Hasnip, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 31, 453001 (2019), 
and appears on the Pareto frontier. 
Some parameters in the Kerker preconditioning have also an effect on the balance between speed and robustness, 
and the default values are good for metallic systems. 
As thouroughly discussed in this reference, there is no fool-proof fast algorithm.

If your SCF cycle do not converge (see nres2 or vres2 column in the output file), the reasons can be: 
(1) Insufficient underlying accuracy in the solution of the Schr√∂dinger at fixed potential 
(2) Transient non-linear behaviour of the SCF, due either to (2a) sudden change of occupation numbers (usually only for metals), or (2b) long-wavelength fluctuations of potential, bigger than the gap.

Start first to address (2), by some tuning which can come without significantly slowing ABINIT. 
Test different values of diemac. 
The default is very large, and suitable fo metals. 
Try running with a small value (perhaps 5) if your system is a bulk semiconductor or a molecule. 
If it is a doped solid, some intermediate value (perhaps 50) might be appropriate.

If this does not work, try to address (1), set tolrde to 0.001, increase the value of [[nline]] 
(e.g. 6 or 8 instead of the default 4), as well as of [[nnsclo]]  (e.g. 2 instead of the default). 
Your residm should be significantly lower than without such modifications, and perhaps your problem will be solved.

If this still does not work, but your residm did not look bad after all before addressing (1), 
then revert back to the default values of [[tolrde]], [[nline]] and [[nnsclo]], as this indeed slows down ABINIT.

Then, try to use [[iscf]] 2. 
This is a very slow but inconditionally convergent algorithm provided [[diemix]] is small enough. 
At some stage of convergence, you might restart with the obtained DEN a better algorithm, 
as non-linear effects should have been eliminated at some stage.
