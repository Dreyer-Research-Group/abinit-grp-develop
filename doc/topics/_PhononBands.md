This page gives hints on how to compute phonon bands, density of states, interatomic force constants, sound
velocity ... with the ABINIT package.

## Introduction

The Fourier transformation of the phonon dynamical matrices generates
interatomic force constants in real space, as explained in
[[cite:Gonze1997a]]. Backtransforming to reciprocal space gives the Fourier
interpolation of the initial phonon band structure. After such Fourier
interpolation, the DOS can be produced (see [[cite:Lee1995]]), the phonon
eigenenergies plotted along lines, the slope of the energy versus cristalline
momentum evaluated (to give sound velocity).

The two-phonon sum and difference spectra can also be obtained, see
[[anaddb:dossum]].

For the related computation of temperature-dependent properties, see [[topic:Temperature]].

* [[lesson:rf2|The lesson Response-Function 2 (RF2)]] presents the analysis of the DDBs that have been introduced in the [[lesson:rf1]]. The computation of the interatomic forces and the computation of thermodynamical properties is an outcome of this lesson.
