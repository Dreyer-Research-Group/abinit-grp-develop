This page gives hints on how to plot phonon band structures with the ABINIT package.

## Introduction

The post-processor band2eps (written in F90, it is one of the executables in
src/98_main) allows one to draw phonon dispersion curves automatically, in a
file written in Encapsulated PostScript (eps). Moreover, a color code allows
to emphasize the contribution of individual atoms to the corresponding
eigenvector (at most three types of atoms).
