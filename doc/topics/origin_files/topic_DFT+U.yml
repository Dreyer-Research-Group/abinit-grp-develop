    introduction : |- 
         <p> This feature is available only in PAW. The DFT+U framework is described in
         [[Anisimov1991]] and [[Liechtenstein1995]]. In ABINIT, the DFT+U approximation is implemented inside the PAW atomic spheres only.
         Two choices of double counting are provided: the Full Localized limit
         and the Around Mean Field approximation.
         Our implementation is described in [[Amadon2008a]].
         It follows the main lines of [[Bengone2000]]. See also [[Czyzyk1994]].
         Forces and stress are implemented.
         For details on keywords 
         ([[lpawu]],[[upawu]],[[jpawu]],[[usedmatpu]],[[dmatpuopt]],[[dmatudiag]]) 
         see keyword [[usepawu]] in input variables.

         <p> In both the output and log files, we can find:
         <p>- The DFT+U contribution of energy which is contained inside the PAW Spherical terms in the output file.
         <p>- The Decomposition of the LDA+U energy is given (Interaction energy, Double
           counting term, and sum of the two) in the log file.
         <p>- The orbital density matrix (n_{m,m'}^{\sigma}), also called occupation
          matrix (corresponding to Eq.(9) of [[Bengone2000]] and Eq.(1) of [[Liechtenstein1995]], see also
           [[Amadon2008a]] and variable [[dmatpuopt]]) is also
           given for each atom in the basis of real spherical harmonics.
           It is given at each SCF step in the log file: one can thus check the
           convergency of the calculation.

         <p> Consistency between total energy and forces in DFT+U have been checked.

         <p> The implementation of DFT+U in ABINIT allows also to impose a starting density matrix in order
         to compare the energy of various electronic configuration (see keywords [[usedmatpu]] and [[dmatpawu]]).
