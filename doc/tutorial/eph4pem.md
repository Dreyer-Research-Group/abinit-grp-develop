# Polaron effective mass in cubic materials with degenerate electronic bands 

This tutorial explains how to compute the polaron effective mass in cubic materials when one deals with degenerate electronic band, be it either valence or conduction. 
As a biproduct of this calculation one obtains the Zero Point Renormalization of the respective set of bands. For the overview of generalized ZPR please refer to 

Further details concerning the implementation are given in [[paper not available yet]]

It is assumed the user has already completed the two tutorials [RF1](/tutorial/rf1) and [RF2](/tutorial/rf2),
and that he/she is familiar with the calculation of ground state (GS) and response properties
in particular phonons, Born effective charges and the high-frequency dielectric tensor.
The user should have read the [introduction tutorial for the EPH code](/tutorial/eph_intro)
before running these examples.

This lesson should take about xx hour.
