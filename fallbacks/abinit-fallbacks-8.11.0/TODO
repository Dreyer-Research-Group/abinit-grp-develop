File lists for 'make distcheck'
-------------------------------

Failure of 'make distcheck' at uninstall because the files are not registered
by the build system.
=> create a config/files/ subdirectory with the lists of installed files
   for each package, to be included in a 'uninstall' target.

Q: does 'uninstall-local' exist?
