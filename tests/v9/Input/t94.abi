#%%   Test collinear treatment as well as non-collinear, with different starting spinat
#%%   See test v9#41 for DFPT, with the same PAW atomic data, and same usexcnhat=0 (default).
#%%   The total energy and stress change very little between all calculations. Good !
#%%   Note however that the SCF convergence is quite slow. Thus the good match was not obtained with 
#%%   the initial value of nstep 12 (now nstep 30).
#%%   Also, note that the restart from a collinear calculation of a non-collinear calculation along z does not work well (DS3).
