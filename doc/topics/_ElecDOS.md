This page gives hints on how to generate the electronic DOS and related topics with the ABINIT package.

## Introduction

A `_DOS` file can be produced either using the tetrahedron method or smearing
approaches. The partial (orbital weighted) DOS can also be obtained. See the

Different plotting post-processor allows one to represent the DOS, including [[topic:Abipy|Abipy]].
