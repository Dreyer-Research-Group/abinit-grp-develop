A.4 Run the "On-demand only slaves"
A.5 Check manually that "make tests_in" works (on one of the slaves)
A.6 Run ./generate_doc.py inside ~abinit/doc

C. For the final merge of a development version  
-----------------------------------------------
C.1 src/make abiauty  and perhaps at some point again abirules ...

C.3 Initialize the next release notes and install notes.

D. For the first merge of a production version (possibly for the first release also)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prepare release notes ...
D.1 To ease comparison, checkout starting revision of corresponding development version
    e.g. in a separate develop, issue git checkout start-8.x.0
D.2 Identify new tests : git status to find the list of NEW input files and refs files, 
    and identify corresponding capability
D.3 Identify new input variables : git diff  of the src/57_iovars/chkvars.F90 file
D.4 Identify new tutorial doc files.
D.5 From the developers : scan the merge requests
D.6 Scan the git log file.
D.7 Identify lacking or incomplete documentation and testing !
D.8 Check and update contributor file
D.9 Contact the relevant people
D.10 (Obsolete - should be replaced by automatic generation on another machine)
Run the green_intel12 slave on the trunk PUBLIC branch => static binary for the group.

Also update install notes and doc/maintainers/statistics.txt
Look at presentation, theory (doc/make presentation theory)

E. For the second and other merges of a production version
-----------------------------------------------
Prepare the release, which means (send a letter to JMB) :
E.1 Make available the files tar.gz, infos.html, robodoc (from abiref*debug)
E.2 Also update install notes and topics.
(The delivery of binary packages has been disabled, as of v7.11.5)
