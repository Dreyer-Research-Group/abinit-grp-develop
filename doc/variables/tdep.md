    - v8:  [[tests/v8/Input/t37.in|t37.in]]







Defines the multiplicity of the SUPERCELL with respect to the primitive UNICELL. See the ABINIT variables [[rprimd]], [[acell]] and [[rprim]] for more details. The multiplicity [[tdep:multiplicity]] and the SUPERCELL lattice parameters [[tdep:rprimd]] are used to find the UNITCELL lattice parameters acell_unitcell such as:

$$ \text{rprimd}_{i,j}=\sum_{k=1}^3 \text{acell_unitcell}_i * \text{multiplicity}_{i,k}*\text{rprim_tmp}_{k,j} $$

For example:

- for a fcc lattice: rprim = ( 0 1/2 1/2 ; 1/2 0 1/2 ; 1/2 1/2 0) and acell = (a a a). If the SUPERCELL is rprimd = (3a 0 0 ; 0 3a 0 ; 0 0 3a), the multiplicity = ( -3 3 3 ; 3 -3 3 ; 3 3 -3) 
- for a bcc lattice: rprim = ( -1/2 1/2 1/2 ; 1/2 -1/2 1/2 ; 1/2 1/2 -1/2) and acell = (a a a). If the SUPERCELL is rprimd = (3a 0 0 ; 0 3a 0 ; 0 0 3a), the multiplicity = ( 0 3 3 ; 3 0 3 ; 3 3 0)
