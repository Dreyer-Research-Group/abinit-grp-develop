This page gives hints on how to perform a molecular dynamics calculation with the Multibinit package.

## Introduction

Multibinit uses the molecular dynamics algorithms implemented in the Abinit software (see [[topic:MolecularDynamics|Molecular dynamics in Abinit]]). For now, only NPT ([[ionmov]]=13) and NVT ([[ionmov]]==12) simulations are available.
  
## Tutorials
The [[tutorial:lattice_model|First lesson on Multibinit]] explains how to build a lattice model and to run a dynamics.
