# Installation notes for ABINIT

This page provides an introduction to the installation of the
ABINIT package and compilation of the executables. 
It indicates also how to test whether the installation/compilation was successfull.
Finally, it gives related complements for the developers.

## Overview

For the vast majority of people willing to use ABINIT (simple users -not developers-), with Unix/Linux or macOS under terminal mode), 
the installation/compilation steps are:

  1. Prerequisite : you need a Fortran compiler, a C compiler, a Python interpreter (>2.7.5), 
     some mandatory libraries (Linalg, FFT, NetCDF, HDF5, LibXC), 
     possibly some recommended libraries (MPI) and other optional libraries (Wannier90, ...). 
     So, know how to invoke these prerequisites, install the libraries if not available immediately with your OS, and know the location of libraries. 
     The libraries can be installed with the help of the "fallback" procedure. See below for more info on this step.
  2. Get the [latest version of the ABINIT package](https://www.abinit.org/packages) (abinit-x.y.z.tar.gz) 
     from the abinit Web site.
     [More information](#how-to-get-a-version-of-abinit) ...
  3. Prepare a file name "hostname".ac9, that contains the information about libraries and compilation options. 
     This is not mandatory, as ABINIT will try to detect the place where these are, but the detection procedure can fail.
     See below for more information, as well as in [this section](#how-to-write-the-hostnameac9-file-) ...
  4. Issue "./configure -q" (or first create a tmp directory, then "cd tmp", then "../configure -q").
     [More information](https://wiki.abinit.org/doku.php?id=build:configure) ...
  5. Issue "make" (or "make -j<n>" for compiling with <n> processors on a SMP machine, e.g. "make -j4" for four processors). Might take dozen of minutes.
     [More information](#how-to-make-the-executables) ...
  6. Issue (optionally) "make install".

The details of step 1 and 3 might vary a lot depending on the operating system.<br />
So, we provide a [Compilation tutorial](tutorial/compilation), covering different installation environments and scenario.
Moreover, there are also Web pages that focus specifically on [macOS](INSTALL_MacOS) users, [CentOS](INSTALL_CentOS) users and [Ubuntu](INSTALL_Ubuntu) users. 
The three latter Web pages also show how to short-circuit the above-mentioned steps using homebrew or MacPorts (for macOS), dnf (for CentOS) or apt (for Ubuntu).<br />
For step 3, examples of configuration files to configure and compile Abinit on clusters are available
in the |abiconfig| package on github 
(specifically the [directory for ABINITv9](https://github.com/abinit/abiconfig/tree/master/abiconfig/clusters)),
while the configuration files
used for our buildbot testfarm are available in the [autoconf_examples section](developers/autoconf_examples/). 
The [ABINIT Wiki](https://wiki.abinit.org) also has a **build abinit** section, that might prove very useful. In particular,
the current documentation of the fallback procedure is available 
[here](https://wiki.abinit.org/doku.php?id=build:fallbacks), as well as [information on the configure](https://wiki.abinit.org/doku.php?id=build:configure).

If you succeeded to make the executables, but would like to check whether
ABINIT has been installed correctly, please go to the [Internal tests section](#how-to-make-the-internal-tests)
and the [Automatic tests section](#how-to-make-the-automatic-tests).

If you want to have a much better handling on ABINIT than normal users, or if
you downloaded ABINIT from Gitlab or GitHub anyhow, then go to the section [For developers](#for-developers).

## How to get a version of ABINIT?

You have a F90 compiler under UNIX/Linux or macOS X and you want simply to
**compile the source files**, and, from time to time, **modify and/or add a
new file**. This is the case of most users, system managers, and also many
developers. 
In what follows, _x.y.z_ represents the ABINIT version.

In order to get the ABINIT package, you have first to download the file
**abinit-_x.y.z_.tar.gz** from the 
[packages page](https://www.abinit.org/packages) of the ABINIT Web site, then issue:

    gunzip abinit-x.y.z.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

That's it. 
<br>
Alternatively, you might also use 

    wget https://www.abinit.org/sites/default/files/packages/abinit-x.y.z.tar.gz
    tar xzf abinit-x.y.z.tar.gz

If correctly done, a main directory, denoted ~abinit in the present document
(usually, its real name will be **abinit-_x.y.z_**) and a whole set of
subdirectories should have been created, including:.

  * the sources of the abinit code, in the directories "src";
  * a fallbacks tarball and a script to create libraries, in the directory "fallbacks";
  * the documentation, in the directory "doc";
  * the complete set of tests, and the pseudopotentials needed for the tests, in the directory "tests";
  * all the scripts and information needed to produce makefiles, in other directories, especially "config".

The package does not contain the object files and the binary executable files.

Many pseudopotentials are not in the installation package.
The package contain several dozen pseudopotentials, for testing purposes, see
~abinit/tests/Psps_for_tests/. However, the largest set of pseudopotentials
and PAW atomic datafiles can be found on the [ABINIT Atomic data pseudopotentials and PAW datasets Web
page](http://www.abinit.org/psp-tables). Other
pseudopotentials have been generated by many different users, and might be
shared, but you might have to contact them.

<!--
The "fallbacks" are **not** in the installation package. They are downloaded from
the Web automatically at configure time. If you do not have the command "wget"
installed on your machine, or if you do not have an access to the internet, you should disable all the fallbacks.
-->

The Web site <https://www.abinit.org> contains many other things, including links to the forum,
the mailing list, the ABINIT events ...

## How to make the executables? 

We now suppose that you have a F90 compiler and you want to compile the source files.

In most cases, you will have to provide to the 'configure' utility some
information: the location of the F90 compiler (and sometimes even the C
compiler) on your machine, the adequate compiler options, and, if you want to
produce the parallel binaries, the location of the MPI library on your machine.

Although the presently implemented building tools should be powerful enough to
succeed to make the binaries without you giving such information, it has been
seen that on a significant number of platforms, it is still better to give
them. Indeed, you might generate a clearly suboptimal executable, executing
slowly, or with downgraded capabilities.

Supposing that you are in the lucky case where the build system is able to
find all the information, then the build of ABINIT is very simple. Issue:

  *  "./configure -q" (or first create a tmp directory, then "cd tmp", then "../configure -q").
  * "make" (or "make -j<n>" for compiling with <n> processors on a SMP machine, e.g. "make -j4" for four processors). Might take two minutes.
  * (optionally) make install

Well, it might also be that only one additional information is needed, in which case something like:

    configure -q FC=gcc
    make 

might work. In both cases, let's explain a bit what is done, and the further possibilities.

The 'configure' step produces the set of Makefile files (among other things),
taking into account information about your machine and the "hostname".ac9 file.
It takes three minute long, or less. The 'make' step compiles everything,
according to the Makefile files produced in the prior step. The time to make
everything is highly dependent on the compiler and platform. On a 2.8 GHz
quad-proc machine (using make -j4), the whole compilation is about 10 minutes.
On some other platforms, with only one processor, it might be more than one hour.

The executables will be located in the subdirectory ~abinit/src/98_main, if
you have chosen to issue ./configure in the ~abinit directory. If you have
issued ./configure in another directory, it will be placed accordingly.

The 'make' command can also be used by mentioning one or more targets. 
It is possible to compile only one of the executable, just after the configure
step by typing:
  
    make name_of_the_binary

(where name_of_the_binary can be abinit, cut3d, anaddb, ...).

Also,
    
    make install

will install abinit in the /usr/local directory.

## How to write the "hostname".ac9 file ?

Let's come back to the case where the build system needs some more
information. This information should be stored in a file named "hostname".ac9,
where "hostname" is the result of executing the command `hostname -s` on your
machine. Note that the command `hostname` will return the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), 
e.g. abiref.pcpm.ucl.ac.be, 
while only the first word of the returned chain of character is needed, e.g. abiref .

There is a template for such "hostname".ac9 file, located in ~abinit/doc/config/. Its name
is config-template.ac9. Examples of such files, that have been used for testing
the package, can be found in ~abinit/doc/build/config-examples/,
or equivalently in the [autoconf_examples section](developers/autoconf_examples/),
or on github, abiconfig project,
[directory for ABINITv9](https://github.com/abinit/abiconfig/tree/master/abiconfig/clusters)). 

Most of the examples provided in the ~abinit/doc/build/config-examples/
directory contain about five definitions: F90 and C locations, F90 and C
options, MPI library location (or the indication that MPI is not enabled). On
the other hand, there are many other possible control flags ("with_XYZ"),
needed for advanced use. In case you have trouble with some library (LibXC,
WANNIER90, ...), you may disable its build.

Your hostname.ac9 file might be placed in your home directory in a new
directory that you will name ~/.abinit/build/. At that location, everytime you
install a new version of ABINIT, the needed information will be found by
ABINIT, so you do not have to care anymore about this file after the first installation.

On the other hand, if you need to play with several computers, you can place
the hostname.ac9 file directory in the ~abinit directory, where such a
hostname.ac9 file will be also seen by the build system (and preferred over the
one located in ~/.abinit/build/) or in your build directory (like
~abinit/tmp/). As mentioned above, you might even type at the terminal the
definitions contained in the hostname.ac9 file.

Note the order of precedence for the location of the hostname.ac9 file (or
command-line information), in case more than one possibility is used,
(decreasing order of precedence):

  * Command line (overcome all other information)
  * Your build directory (~abinit/tmp/)
  * The ABINIT top source directory (~abinit/)
  * ~/.abinit/build/
  * /etc/abinit/build/

When the hostname.ac9 file is ready, you can come back to the
configure/make sequence.

## How to make the internal tests?

In case you are running under Unix (Linux or another flavour), the abinit code
has several small internal tests (three basic ones, called "fast", "v1" and
"v5", and then one for each of the libraries "bigdft", "etsf_io", "libxc",
"wannier90"), that can be issued automatically, and that check themselves
whether the results that have been obtained are right or wrong. These tests
are available whether you have got the package from the Web or from the ABINIT
archive. Of course, you need to have compiled abinit in order to run the
internal tests. Moreover, the simple implementation procedure assumes that the
executable is located in ~abinit/src/98_main (the standard location after
issuing "make").

You can begin with the test "fast". Simply issue the command:
    
    make test_fast

It will run during a few seconds. It should print:

```text
Status file, reporting on built-in test fast

==> The run finished cleanly.
    Moreover, comparison of the total energy, and other (few) relevant quantities with reference values has been successful.
    This does not mean that no problem is present, however.
    Please run the complete set of ABINIT tests to gain a better confidence in your installation.
```

This means that the internal test "fast" ran successfully. If you do not get
this message, then the executables were not properly generated, or there is a
problem with the makefile that drives the internal test. In this case, after
having tried to solve the problem by yourself, you should contact somebody in
the ABINIT group.

In addition to this small message, you can have access to all generated files,
that are located inside the tests/built-in/Input subdirectory.

Supposing test "fast" was OK, then you might issue the command:
    
    make tests_in

The test "fast" will be done once more, followed by the other internal tests.
Again, we hope that you will get the positive diagnostics for the other tests.
Of course, the "bigdft", "etsf_io", "libxc", and "wannier90" needs the
appropriate library to be installed in order to work properly.

For further information on these internal tests, see the ~abinit/tests/built-in/README file.

You might now read the [new user's guide](..), in
order to learn how to use the code, and then to follow the four basic
tutorials, see the [entry page for the tutorials](tutorial/index.md).
This is useful if you consider that the installation has been successful. Or
you might continue to read the present Web page, and try to perform the speed
tests, as well as the other tests.

## How to make the automatic tests?

The workhorse script to run the tests is called runtests.py . It is very
flexible. A reasonable set of tests (those contained in the fast and v"x"
directories), can be run automatically by issue inside the ~abinit/tests directory the command:
    
    ./runtests.py

or e.g.
    
    ./runtests.py -j4

(if you have 4 cores on your computer)

This is the recommended procedure for developers. In order to execute these
tests, you will need a larger disk space than for the simple installation of
the code (the total additional disk space required is on the order of 1GB).

The comman line options of runtests.py are numerous. Please issue

    ./runtests.py --help

in order to get the list, or consult the video below.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/40324.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/40324)

Let us now examine the different subdirectories of the ~abinit/tests directory..

~ABINIT/tests/fast/ is the simplest, and its content will be described in some
detail below. For tests of the parallel version see the directory
tests/paral/. For tests
of the response function features of abinit, and for tests of mrgddb and
anaddb, see the subdirectories tests/v2. The other directories tests/v3,
tests/v4, ... presents further tests of recently implemented features of ABINIT.

**1) tests/fast/** (for the sequential version only)

This subdirectory contains a basic set of tests of the code, aimed at testing
whether the code is coherent in time (successive versions), and exercising
several parts of the code. However, they do not examine its accuracy on
physical problems, mainly because the number of plane waves used is too small,
and some tests are not run to self-consistent convergence. 32 MB of memory
should be enough for these tests.

The input files for each of the tests can be found in the
~abinit/tests/fast/Input directory. At the bottom of the each of the input
file, some metadata is present. Such metadata mentions the executable to be
used (automatically), possibly the other input files (like pseudopotentials),
the output files to be analyzed, the admitted tolerances with respect to
reference output files, the author of the test, and a brief description of the test.

To run only the tests in this directory, simply issue, in the ~abinit/tests/ directory:
    
    ./runtests.py fast

It will create a directory named Test_suite. All the results will be in that
directory. The output files will be automatically compared, thanks to a 'diff'
command, to a set of reference files (in ~abinit/tests/fast/Refs/). The
corresponding difference files are prefixed by 'diff.'.

In addition to 'diff', there are two other levels of automatic analysis: one
based on a comparing tool called 'fldiff', producing 'fldiff.report' files,
and another where the output of 'fldiff' is further analyzed, and produce a
brief report called 'report'. The latter step is only performed in case all
the tests cases of one directory are performed (including the case where tests
of different directories are performed)

The one-line summaries produced by fldiff (see later) are compared with the
tolerances indicated in the input file (metadata added at the end of the input
file). This procedure produces a file called "report", in which there is a one
line assessment of the behaviour of each test: succeeded (everything is OK),
passed (the test is OK for users in production), passed marginally (the test
is within 1.5 of the usually accepted deviation, which is likely OK for most
applications - still to be improved by the development team, though), failed
(there is a problem, the deviation is usually not accepted). This is by far
the most convenient tool to analyze the automatic tests of abinit.

The vast majority of tests cases succeed or pass on all platforms that are
used by the developer team in Louvain-la-neuve. Some problems are mentioned in
the file ~abinit/KNOWN_PROBLEMS , Additionally, there might be specific
problems for some test case for some platforms, also mentioned in
~abinit/KNOWN_PROBLEMS. So, apart of the known problems, mentioned in this
file, the "report" file should mention, for each test case, only "succeeded" or "passed".

The comparing tool 'fldiff' -for 'floating diff'- performs in a more detailed
way the comparison of floating numbers between the output files and the
reference files than in the case of a 'diff' command. As used presently, for
each run inside one directory, one single file, called 'fldiff.report', will
be produced, and gather the analysis for all tests in that directory.

If for one test case, the two files differ by the number of lines, the
'fldiff.report' file will report that it cannot compare the two files. Usually
this problem will be seen at the level of 'command signs' appearing sometimes
in the first column of the output files, so a typical error message
(announcing something went wrong) will be:
    
    Case_1
    22
    The diff analysis cannot be pursued: the command sign differ.

By contrast, it will identify the floating numbers and ignore their
differences if they are within some prescribed tolerance, or if the difference
is not relevant. For example, it is able to ignore the differences in timings.
If everything goes fine for a test, fldiff should identify only the
differences in:

  * the dates of execution (possibly);
  * the version numbers (possibly);
  * the platform description (possibly);
  * the overall execution time (this is ALWAYS printed, even without differences).

So, a successful execution of one test case may be announced as follows in the fldiff.report file:
    
    Case_1
    2
    <  Version 8.0.6  of ABINIT
    >  Version 8.0.3  of ABINIT
    5
    <  Starting date: Mon 23 May 2016.
    >  Starting date: Mon  4 Apr 2016
    202
    < +overall time at end (sec): cpu=          7.1  wall=          8.0
    > +Overall time at end (sec): cpu=          7.3  wall=          8.0
    Summary Case_1: no significant difference has been found
    

The fldiff.report file will have one such section for each test_case that was
run. It begins with the number of the test case, then includes a few blocks of
three lines: the number of the line where something is happening, followed by
the content of the two lines. Finally, there is a one-line summary for each test case.

More information on the fldiff script can be found in the ~abinit/tests/Scripts/fldiff.pl file.

**2) tests/v1**

This directory contains tests built in the same spirit as those in the
test/fast directory, but that exercise other basic features, like the
treatment of metals, the GGA, the new pseudopotentials, the multi-dataset
mode, the cell parameters optimization, and the spatial symmetry groups
database. These were developed during the development time of the version 1 of
ABINIT. Of course, the automatic difference procedure only compares to recent
runs of the ABINIT code. As for the 'fast' test cases, the fldiff.report and
report files are also available. 64 MB of memory should be enough for these tests.

**3) tests/v2**

This directory contains tests built in the same spirit as those in the
tests/fast/ or tests/v1 directory, but that exercise features not present in
version 1 of the ABINIT package, mainly the response function features, and
the use of the mrgddb and anaddb codes. Again, the automatic difference
procedure only compares to recent runs of the ABINIT code. As for the 'fast'
test cases, the fldiff.report and report files are also available. 64 MB of
memory should be enough for these tests.

**4) tests/v3, tests/v4, tests/v5, tests/v6, tests/v67mbpt, tests/v7, tests/v8, tests/v9, tests/bigdft, 
    tests/etsf_io, tests/libxc, tests/wannier90**

These directories contain tests built in the same spirit as those in the
tests/fast/, tests/v1, tests/v2 directory, but that exercise features not present in the
version 1 or 2 of the ABINIT package, noticeably the
use of the GW code, the utilities Cut3d, AIM, .., the PAW ... . Or the
interfacing with fallbacks. Again, the automatic difference procedure only
compares to recent runs of the ABINIT code. Like for the 'fast' test cases, the
fldiff.report and report files are also available. 64 MB of memory should be
enough for these tests.

**5) tests/paral/ and tests/mpiio/** (need MPI support)

This directory contains tests built in the same spirit as those in the
test/fast/ directory, but that exercise the parallel version of the ABINIT code.

The script runtests.py considers one of the different input files, and for
this file, it will use the parallel code with one processing node, then
perform different parallel runs with an increasing number of processing nodes,
as specified in the metadata contained in the input file. As for the other
series of test, the diff and the fldiff utilities are used automatically, and
fldiff.report and report files are produced automatically.

## For developers.

Note the documentation available in the pages labelled [Developers](developers),
as well as the [developer's corner of the Wiki](https://wiki.abinit.org)
The following sections are complements for the installation from gitlab, and the generation of the
ABINIT distribution.

### Git, autotools and makemake.

If you want to have a full handle on the package (compilation, modification of files, writing
of scripts, you need additional prerequisites, the 
(free) software applications git, automake, autoconf, libtools. 

More explicitly, you need minimally (version numbers can  be upgraded)

 * [GNU Autoconf 2.69](ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.69.tar.gz)
 * [GNU Automake 1.15](ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/automake-1.15.tar.gz)
 * [GNU Libtool 2.2.4](ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-2.2.4.tar.gz)
 * [GNU M4 1.4](ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.4.tar.gz)

If you do not have these tools, and would like to have them, please consult
your local computer guru, and/or the following pages:

  * [An overview of ABINIT development](https://wiki.abinit.org/doku.php?id=developers:overview)
  * [10 steps to hike ABINIT](https://wiki.abinit.org/doku.php?id=developers:hike)
  * [Buildbot and the test farm](https://wiki.abinit.org/doku.php?id=bb:overview)

If you want to develop on a regular basis, please have a Git(lab) access
created for you by contacting Jean-Michel Beuken, as described in these pages.
If it is only very occasional, you might as well rely on the [ABINIT Github Web site](https://github.com/abinit).

It is strongly advised to subscribe to the [ABINIT forum](https://forum.abinit.org/)
if you want to be able to get the latest information concerning the autotools development mode.

After having installed git, and obtained a gitlab (or github) branch on the ABINIT worldwide
repository, create an automomous copy of the source code, on top of which you
have to make your development.
This is explained in the ABINIT wiki
[git(lab): ABINIT specificities](https://wiki.abinit.org/doku.php?id=developers:git:specificities_git_abinit)

For your branches on the ABINIT worldwide repository, you will have the
permission not only to clone/fetch/pull, but also to commit/push your
modifications. You might alternatively download other branches of the
archives, but you will not be able to commit in these branches. So, do not
start to modify these, you will not be able to include them afterwards in the archive.

Working with `git clone` creates a local archive for your daily work, this
archive being linked to the main ABINIT archive. This very efficient technique
is recommended, as it makes you more independent for the management of your
work (you will be able to create new branches). One big advantage of this
technique is that people working with a laptop can develop and commit safely
without a network connection.

Then, make sure you have the ABINIT prerequisite (compilers, libraries ...), and that you
have set up a *.ac9 file.

At this stage, before being able to compile, cd to the newly created abinit directory, and issue:

    ./config/scripts/makemake

This command initializes a whole set of files and scripts, needed for the
autotools, as well as for the global work on ABINIT sources. This
initialization might take up to two minutes.
After this initialisation, you can proceed with the configure/make procedure
as described in section 2.

### To generate the source package.

If you want to produce the source package abinit-_x.y.z_.tar.gz, after having compiled and tested ABINIT, issue:
    
    make dist

in ~abinit/.

Please, change its name (e.g. add your name after _**x.y.z**_), to
identify that this is a modified version of ABINIT.
