This file provides a description of suggested acknowledgments and references to be inserted in scientific papers 
whose results have been obtained thanks to ABINIT. It discusses also briefly the problem of co-authorship.

<h3><b><a name="a"></a>A. Introduction</b></h3>

In the section <a href="bib_acknow.html#b">B. List of suggestions</a>, you will find
several references we suggest you to cite in your papers that have benefited from ABINIT.
However, we wish first to clarify the spirit in which the present document (Acknowledgments) has
been written. The users of the code have no formal obligations
with respect to the ABINIT group (within the limits of the GNU General
Public License). However, it is common practice
in the scientific literature, to acknowledge the efforts of people
that have made the research possible.
<p>Please note the following :
<ul>
<li>1) The ABINIT project, in order to be viable, should be known
  as a robust tool, that has been tested, and that has allowed
  good scientific research. This will be
  facilitated if the ABINIT project is mentioned properly in research papers.
<li>2) Some recent ideas and algorithms are coded, and it would be fair to cite these.
<li>3) You might also register on the <a href="https://forum.abinit.org">ABINIT forum</a>.
  Indirectly, this also helps the ABINIT developer group, because
  the total number of registered people on the ABINIT forum
  is often cited as an indicator of the user community size.
</ul>
In agreement with the GNU General Public License, there
is no request for co-authorship of articles whose scientific results
have been obtained thanks to ABINIT, by any ABINIT developer.
This applies even for recently implemented features, as their
availability in a public version is governed by the GNU GPL license.
If you think your work could benefit from collaboration with
ABINIT developers, you can contact the ABINIT group
for a possible arrangement, in which case co-authorship should be discussed.
(Of course, the ABINIT developpers also have the right
to decline giving assistance to users ...).

<h3><b><a name="b"></a>B. List of suggestions</b></h3>

<p>
The first general ABINIT paper [<a href="bib_acknow.html#1">B.1</a>],
in the list of suggestions below, should be cited
in papers that have benefited from the ABINIT project, irrespective of their content.
There are three other ABINIT papers,
[<a href="bib_acknow.html#2">B.2</a>],
[<a href="bib_acknow.html#3">B.3</a>],[<a href="bib_acknow.html#4">B.4</a>],
that might as well be considered,
irrespective of the content of the paper, because these papers are quite general as well,
although they are older (2009, 2005 and 2002).
<br>
There are also many articles that are more focused: they describe some specific capability of ABINIT.
The following list is actually not complete ... More references will be proposed by ABINIT itself (see the end of the output file),
see the <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_allvars.html#">database</a> of information on the input variables,
in the <a href="../../topics/generated_files/all_topics.html">"topics" files</a>,
as well as in the references of the four general papers ...

<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>B.1<a name="1"></a></b>. At least, the most recent article <a href="../../biblio/generated_files/bib_biblio.html#Gonze2016">[Gonze2016]</a> that describes the ABINIT project should be
  mentioned in the bibliography section of your paper.
  A version of this paper, that is not formatted for Computer Phys. Comm.
  is available at <a href="https://www.abinit.org/sites/default/files/ABINIT16.pdf">https://www.abinit.org/about/ABINIT16.pdf</a>.
  The licence allows the authors to put it on the Web.
  <li><b>B.2<a name="2"></a></b>. The previous ABINIT article <a href="../../biblio/generated_files/bib_biblio.html#Gonze2009">[Gonze2009]</a> is especially detailed. 
  A version of this paper, that is not formatted for Computer Phys. Comm.
  is available <a href="https://www.abinit.org/sites/default/files/about/ABINIT_CPC_v10.pdf">here</a>.
  The licence allows the authors to put it on the Web.
  <li><b>B.3<a name="3"></a></b>. The 2005 ABINIT article <a href="../../biblio/generated_files/bib_biblio.html#Gonze2005">[Gonze2005]</a> is quite short.
  The .pdf of the latter paper is available <a href="https://www.abinit.org/sites/default/files/zfk_0505-06_558-562.pdf">here</a>.
  Note that it should not redistributed (Copyright by Oldenburg Wissenshaftverlag, the licence allows the authors
  to put it on the Web).
  <li><b>B.4<a name="4"></a></b>. The very first paper on the ABINIT project <a href="../../biblio/generated_files/bib_biblio.html#Gonze2002">[Gonze2002]</a> might also be considered for citation.
  <li><b>B.5<a name="5"></a>.</b> If the Projector-Augmented Wave method as implemented in ABINIT is used <a href="../../biblio/generated_files/bib_biblio.html#Torrent2008">[Torrent2008]</a> should be mentioned.
  <li><b>B.6<a name="6"></a>.</b> Many ingredients needed for the calculations of responses to
  atomic displacements or homogeneous electric fields (dynamical matrices, effective
  charges and dielectric constants), as well as the Fourier interpolation implemented
  in the 'anaddb' code are described in <a href="../../biblio/generated_files/bib_biblio.html#Gonze1997">[Gonze1997]</a> and <a href="../../biblio/generated_files/bib_biblio.html#Gonze1997a">[Gonze1997a]</a>.
  <li><b>B.7<a name="7"></a>.</b> The methods used for the calculation of responses to
  homogeneous strain (elastic tensors, piezoelectric tensors, and
  internal force-response tensors) are described in <a href="../../biblio/generated_files/bib_biblio.html#Hamann2005">[Hamann2005]</a>.
  <li> <b>B.8<a name="8"></a>.</b> If the "static" non-linear capabilities of ABINIT are used (Raman efficiencies,
  electro-optic coefficients ... ), cite <a href="../../biblio/generated_files/bib_biblio.html#Veithen2005">[Veithen2005]</a>
  <li> <b>B.9<a name="9"></a>.</b> If the integration over the phonon degrees of freedom is used 
  (<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_anaddb.html#thmflag@anaddb">thmflag</a>), cite <a href="../../biblio/generated_files/bib_biblio.html#Lee1995">[Lee1995]</a>.
  <li> <b>B.10<a name="10"></a>.</b> If the self-consistent capabilities of ABINIT beyond DFT are used (GW, COHSEX, HF, etc), cite <a href="../../biblio/generated_files/bib_biblio.html#Bruneval2006">[Bruneval2006]</a>.
  <li> <b>B.11<a name="11"></a>.</b> If the completeness relationship is used to speed up the
  convergence with respect to the number of bands in a GW calculation (input variables <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_gw.html#gwcomp">gwcomp</a> and <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_gw.html#gwencomp">gwencomp</a>), cite <a href="../../biblio/generated_files/bib_biblio.html#Bruneval2008">[Bruneval2008]</a>
  <li> <b>B.12<a name="12"></a>.</b> If the massive parallelism of ABINIT (coupled band / FFT
  or even coupled band / FFT / k points ) is used, cite <a href="../../biblio/generated_files/bib_biblio.html#Bottin2008">[Bottin2008]</a> 
  (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3405">available on Arxiv.org</a>)</cite>.
