This page gives hints on how to  with the ABINIT package.

## Introduction

ABINIT is developed under the control of [git](https://git-scm.com/) and 
the development is based on the 
[Gitflow branching model](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
There is an official [github mirror](https://github.com/abinit/abinit)
where we welcome bug fixes and improvements. 
Note, however, that most of the active developments are hosted on our 
internal [Gitlab server](https://gitlab.abinit.org/).
Before embarking on making significant changes, please contact the Abinit group.

See the many different projects linked to ABINIT on Github
actually gathered in the [Github ABINIT organization](https://github.com/abinit).
