# Input variables added by CED and their use

## Flexo phonon:
- `adcalc`: Set to 1 for adiabatic response calculation, 2 for diamagnetic (i.e., CRG) calculation (previously `userib`)
- `nogzero`: Remove G=0 term from electrostatic potential (previously `useria`)
- `joperloc`: Default (0) means joper uses local+nl; -1 mean joper uses only local  
- `pmpath`: 0 (default) is ICL path, 1 is PM

## Flexo metric:
- `metcalc`: Set to one to indicate that 

## Velocity-force and naBEC:
- `vfstep`: Triggers velfrc, 1 for first pert, 2 for second (previously `useria`)
- `drudewt`: Turn on Drude weight, first digit is direction a, second is direction b (previously `useric`)
- `vlfrceta`: size of the imaginary part for causality (previously `userra`)
